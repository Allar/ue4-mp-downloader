# ue4-mp-downloader
Shell utility to download owned assets from the UE4 marketplace.

# Installation

## NodeJS required

Install NodeJS for your operating system, instructions here:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

## Using NPM

Once you installed NodeJS, you should have a command-line tool called 'npm' working.

Run the following:
`npm install -g Allar/ue4-mp-downloader`

This will download this repo you're looking at now and install it as a global node module.

# Usage

Once installed as a global node module, you can run the following from any directory:

`ue4-mp-downloader`

You will be prompted to log in. This tool does not save or record your credentials for your safety, so you will have to log in every time you use it.

Once logged in, any assets downloaded will be downloaded to your current working directory in a folder called `download`.
